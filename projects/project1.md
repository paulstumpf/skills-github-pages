# DCF Model for a Tech Company

## Project Overview
This project involves building a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model** to value a hypothetical publicly traded tech company. The goal was to calculate its intrinsic value based on future cash flow projections and a discount rate.

## Key Highlights
- **Objective**: Determine the company's fair market value and compare it to its current market price to assess whether it's undervalued or overvalued.
- **Financial Data Source**: The model is based on financial statements sourced from publicly available data.
- **Key Metrics**: 
  - Free Cash Flow (FCF)
  - Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
  - Net Present Value (NPV)
  - Terminal Value (TV)

## Approach and Methodology
1. **Collecting Data**: Sourced income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements to calculate historical FCF trends.
2. **Projecting Future Cash Flows**:
   - Assumed 5 years of growth based on industry trends and company-specific factors.
   - Incorporated conservative, base, and aggressive growth scenarios.
3. **Calculating Discount Rate**:
   - Determined WACC using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
   - Factored in risk-free rate, beta, and market risk premium.
4. **Calculating Terminal Value**:
   - Applied the perpetuity growth method using a long-term growth rate.
5. **Valuation**:
   - Discounted projected cash flows and terminal value to present value (PV).

## Key Insights
- The DCF analysis revealed that the company is **undervalued** by approximately 15% compared to its current market price.
- The **sensitivity analysis** highlighted how changes in WACC and growth rates impact valuation outcomes.
