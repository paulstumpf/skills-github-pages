# M&A Analysis for Healthcare Industry

## Project Overview
This project focuses on evaluating the feasibility and financial impact of a merger between two hypothetical healthcare companies. The analysis aims to identify synergies, estimate cost savings, and assess whether the deal creates value for shareholders.

## Key Highlights
- **Objective**: Analyze the financial viability of the merger and determine the potential post-merger valuation.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Synergies (Revenue and Cost Synergies)
  - Earnings Per Share (EPS) Accretion/Dilution Analysis
  - Post-Merger Valuation
  - Debt-to-Equity Ratio (Impact of Financing Structure)

## Approach and Methodology
1. **Company Data Collection**:
   - Gathered financial statements and operational metrics for both companies.
   - Identified potential sources of synergies, including cost-cutting measures and increased market share.
2. **Modeling Assumptions**:
   - Assumed annual cost synergies of $50 million and revenue synergies of $30 million.
   - Factored in integration costs and timeline (spanning 2 years).
3. **Accretion/Dilution Analysis**:
   - Calculated the combined EPS post-merger to determine whether the deal was accretive or dilutive for shareholders.
4. **Post-Merger Valuation**:
   - Integrated the financial statements of both companies to create a pro forma income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.
   - Used these to calculate the post-merger enterprise value.
5. **Financing Considerations**:
   - Evaluated different financing structures, including all-cash, all-stock, and mixed options.
   - Assessed the impact on leverage ratios and cost of capital.

## Key Insights
- The merger creates **$80 million in synergies** (cost savings and revenue growth combined), resulting in a 5% increase in total enterprise value.
- The EPS analysis showed **accretion of 8%**, making the deal favorable for shareholders.
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio remained within industry norms, ensuring financial stability post-merger.
